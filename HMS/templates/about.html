                <p class = "text-center">
                    Every student wants a nice hostel close to campus, but almost always we find that students and hostels managers end up in a stressful mess because students will book late and hostel managers will keep overbooking.
                    Students are also left at the mercy of the hostel managers to decide which room they go, if they cannot make the trip to choose their room.
                    Sometimes the students end up without rooms because the hostel managers overbooked and cannot identify the first or last person on their lists.
                    That's where HMS comes in, to offer students a stress free hostel booking service and a chance to actually see and choose the room they want to be in.
                    We also completely erase the manager's hurdles by booking only the right number and giving them direct access to students.

                   We began operations in 2018 when we as students realised the stress and frustration it took just to get the perfect room.
                    Hostel managers immediately understood our value proposition and today we manage all the hostels on the Ashesi campusðŸ˜‰
